This adapter allows Astro to deploy your [`hybrid` or `server` rendered site](/en/basics/rendering-modes/#on-demand-rendered) to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

If you're using Astro as a [static site builder](/en/basics/rendering-modes/#pre-rendered), you don't need an adapter.

Learn how to deploy your Astro site in our [Cloudflare Pages deployment guide](/en/guides/deploy/cloudflare/).

## Why Astro Cloudflare

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) provides CDNs, web security, and other services. This adapter enhances the Astro build process to prepare your project for deployment through Cloudflare.

## Installation

Astro includes an `astro add` command to automate the setup of official integrations. If you prefer, you can [install integrations manually](#manual-install) instead.

Add the Cloudflare adapter to enable SSR in your Astro project with the `astro add` command. This will install `@astrojs/cloudflare` and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npx astro add cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm astro add cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn astro add cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

### Manual Install

First, add the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter to your project's dependencies using your preferred package manager.

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```sh
  npm install @astrojs/cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```sh
  pnpm add @astrojs/cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```sh
  yarn add @astrojs/cloudflare
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Then, add the adapter and your desired [on-demand rendering mode](/en/basics/rendering-modes/#on-demand-rendered) to your `astro.config.mjs` file:

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={2,5-6}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server',
  adapter: cloudflare(),
});
```

## Options

### routes.include

<p>

**Type:** `string[]`<br />
**Default:** `[]`
</p>

If you want to use the automatic `_routes.json` generation, but want to include additional routes (e.g. when having custom functions in the `functions` folder), you can use the `routes.include` option to add additional routes to the `include` array.

### routes.exclude

<p>

**Type:** `string[]`<br />
**Default:** `[]`
</p>

If you want to use the automatic `_routes.json` generation, but want to exclude additional routes, you can use the `routes.exclude` option to add additional routes to the `exclude` array.

The following example automatically generates `_routes.json` while including and excluding additional routes. Note that that is only necessary if you have custom functions in the `functions` folder that are not handled by Astro.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-8}
export default defineConfig({
  adapter: cloudflare({
    mode: 'directory',
    routes: {
      strategy: 'include',
      include: ['/users/*'], // handled by custom function: functions/users/[id].js
      exclude: ['/users/faq'], // handled by static page: pages/users/faq.astro
    },
  }),
});
```

### `wasmModuleImports`

<p>

**Type:** `true | false`<br />
**Default:** `false`
</p>

Whether or not to import `.wasm` files [directly as ES modules](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/tree/main/proposals/esm-integration) using the `.wasm?module` import syntax.

Add `wasmModuleImports: true` to `astro.config.mjs` to enable this functionality in both the Cloudflare build and the Astro dev server. Read more about [using Wasm modules](#use-wasm-modules).

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={6}
import {defineConfig} from "astro/config";
import cloudflare from '@astrojs/cloudflare';

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: cloudflare({
     wasmModuleImports: true
  }),
  output: 'server'
})
```

## Cloudflare runtime

The Cloudflare runtime gives you access to environment variables and Cloudflare bindings. You can find more information in Cloudflare's [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/bindings/) and [Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings/) docs. Depending on your deployment type (`pages` or `workers`), you need to configure the bindings differently.

Currently supported bindings:

* Environment Variables
* [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/)
* [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)
* [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)
* [Cloudflare Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/)
* [Cloudflare Service bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/bindings/about-service-bindings/)

### Config

#### Cloudflare Workers

To deploy your workers project to production, you need to configure the bindings using a `wrangler.toml` config file in the root directory of your Astro project. To be able to access bindings locally, the `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter will also read the `wrangler.toml` file.

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
name = "example"

# example of a KV Binding
kv_namespaces = [
    { binding = "KV", id = "KV", preview_id = "KV" },
]

# example of a var binding (environment variables)
[vars]
URL = "example.com"

# example of a D1 Binding
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "D1"
database_name = "D1"
database_id = "D1"
preview_database_id = "D1"

# example of a R2 Binding
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = 'R2'
bucket_name = 'R2'

# example of a Durable Object Binding
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DO"
class_name = "DO"

# example of a Service binding
[[services]]
binding = "AUTH"
service = "auth-worker"
```

If you also need to define `secrets` in addition to environment variables, you need to add a `.dev.vars` file to the root of the Astro project:

```ini title=".dev.vars"
DB_PASSWORD=myPassword
```

### Usage

You can access the runtime from Astro components through `Astro.locals` inside any `.astro` file.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
const runtime = Astro.locals.runtime;
---

<pre>{JSON.stringify(runtime.env)}</pre>
```

You can access the runtime from API endpoints through `context.locals`:

```js title="src/pages/api/someFile.js"
export function GET(context) {
  const runtime = context.locals.runtime;

  return new Response('Some body');
}
```

### Typing

You can type the `runtime` object using `AdvancedRuntime`:

```ts title="src/env.d.ts"
/// <reference types="astro/client" />

type KVNamespace = import('@cloudflare/workers-types/experimental').KVNamespace;
type ENV = {
  SERVER_URL: string;
  KV_BINDING: KVNamespace;
};

type Runtime = import('@astrojs/cloudflare').AdvancedRuntime<ENV>;

declare namespace App {
  interface Locals extends Runtime {
    user: {
      name: string;
      surname: string;
    };
  }
}
```

## Platform

### Headers

You can attach [custom headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/headers/) to your responses by adding a `_headers` file in your Astro project's `public/` folder. This file will be copied to your build output directory.

### Assets
Assets built by Astro are all named with a hash and therefore can be given long cache headers. By default, Astro on Cloudflare will add such a header for these files.

### Redirects

You can declare [custom redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/) using Cloudflare Pages. This allows you to redirect requests to a different URL. You can add a `_redirects` file in your Astro project's `public/` folder. This file will be copied to your build output directory.

### Routes

You can define which routes are invoking functions and which are static assets, using [Cloudflare routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes) via a `_routes.json` file. This file is automatically generated by Astro.

#### Custom `_routes.json`

By default, `@astrojs/cloudflare` will generate a `_routes.json` file with `include` and `exclude` rules based on your applications's dynamic and static routes.
This will enable Cloudflare to serve files and process static redirects without a function invocation. Creating a custom `_routes.json` will override this automatic optimization. See [Cloudflare's documentation on creating a custom `routes.json`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#create-a-_routesjson-file) for more details.

## Use Wasm modules

The following is an example of importing a Wasm module that then responds to requests by adding the request's number parameters together.

```js title="pages/add/[a]/[b].js"
import mod from '../util/add.wasm?module';

// instantiate ahead of time to share module
const addModule: any = new WebAssembly.Instance(mod);

export async function GET(context) {
  const a = Number.parseInt(context.params.a);
  const b = Number.parseInt(context.params.b);
  return new Response(`${addModule.exports.add(a, b)}`);
}
```

While this example is trivial, Wasm can be used to accelerate computationally intensive operations which do not involve significant I/O such as embedding an image processing library.

## Node.js compatibility

Out of the box, Cloudflare does not support the full Node.js runtime API. With some configuration, Cloudflare does support a subset of the Node.js runtime APIs. The following APIs are supported:

* assert
* AsyncLocalStorage
* Buffer
* Crypto
* Diagnostics Channel
* EventEmitter
* path
* process
* Streams
* StringDecoder
* util

To use these APIs, your page or endpoint must be server-side rendered (not pre-rendered) and must use the the `import {} from 'node:*'` import syntax.

```js title="pages/api/endpoint.js"
export const prerender = false;
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
```

Additionally, you'll need to enable the Compatibility Flag in Cloudflare. The configuration for this flag may vary based on where you deploy your Astro site. For detailed guidance, please refer to the [Cloudflare documentation on enabling Node.js compatibility](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs).


:::note[Package Compatibility Implications]
If a project imports a package into the server that uses the Node.js runtime APIs, this can cause issues when deploying to Cloudflare. This issue arises with package that do not use the `node:*` import syntax. It is recommended that you contact the authors of the package to determine if the package supports the above import syntax. If the package does not support this, you may need to use a different package or change adapters.

## Cloudflare module support

All Cloudflare namespaced packages (e.g. `cloudflare:sockets`) are allowlisted for use. Note that the package `cloudflare:sockets` does not work locally without using Wrangler dev mode.

## Preview with Wrangler

To use [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) to run your application locally, update the preview script:

```json title="package.json"
"preview": "wrangler pages dev ./dist"
```

[`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) gives you access to [Cloudflare bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings), [environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/bindings/#environment-variables), and the [cf object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties). Getting hot reloading or the astro dev server to work with Wrangler might require custom setup. See [community examples](https://github.com/withastro/roadmap/discussions/590).

### Meaningful error messages

Currently, errors during running your application in Wrangler are not very useful, due to the minification of your code. For better debugging, you can add `vite.build.minify = false` setting to your `astro.config.mjs`.

```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-8}
export default defineConfig({
  adapter: cloudflare(),
  output: 'server',
  vite: {
    build: {
      minify: false,
    },
  },
});
```
